## Getting Started

After cloning the project and changing into its directory install necessary dependencies with  
`npm i`  
After that’s finished start the crawler with  
`node crawler.js`  
 Currently, puppeteer is launched with headless set to false, this launches chromium so the user can see the crawler in action, but you can set headless to false if you want the crawler to run in the background.

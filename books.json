Until now.\\n\\nFor years, behind the closed doors of their farmhouse in Raymond, Washington, their sadistic mother, Shelly, subjected her girls to unimaginable abuse, degradation, torture, and psychic terrors. Through it all, Nikki, Sami, and Tori developed a defiant bond that made them far less vulnerable than Shelly imagined. Even as others were drawn into their mother’s dark and perverse web, the sisters found the strength and courage to escape an escalating nightmare that culminated in multiple murders.\\n\\nHarrowing and heartrending, If You Tell is a survivor’s story of absolute evil—and the freedom and justice that Nikki, Sami, and Tori risked their lives to fight for. Sisters forever, victims no more, they found a light in the darkness that made them the resilient women they are today—loving, loved, and moving on.\",\"imgURLs\":[\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410K-S--pmL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\",\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vGdtnCNhL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\"],\"productDimensions\":\"5.5 x 1 x 8.2 inches\",\"weight\":\"15.4 ounces\"}",

Not his brother Roy, who ran the company’s finances; not the bankers; and not his wife, Lillian. Amusement parks at that time, such as Coney Island, were a generally despised business, sagging and sordid remnants of bygone days. Disney was told that he would only be heading toward financial ruin.\\n\\nBut Walt persevered, initially financing the park against his own life insurance policy and later with sponsorship from ABC and the sale of thousands and thousands of Davy Crockett coonskin caps. Disney assembled a talented team of engineers, architects, artists, animators, landscapers, and even a retired admiral to transform his ideas into a soaring yet soothing wonderland of a park. The catch was that they had only a year and a day in which to build it.\\n\\nOn July 17, 1955, Disneyland opened its gates…and the first day was a disaster. Disney was nearly suicidal with grief that he had failed on a grand scale. But the curious masses kept coming, and the rest is entertainment history. Eight hundred million visitors have flocked to the park since then. In Disney’s Land, Richard Snow brilliantly presents the entire spectacular story, a wild ride from vision to realization, and an epic of innovation and error that reflects the uniqueness of the man determined to build “the happiest place on earth” with a watchmaker’s precision, an artist’s conviction, and the desperate, high-hearted recklessness of a riverboat gambler.\",\"imgURLs\":[\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51f0RC%2B3FOL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\",\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Xhx5UKeOL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\"],\"productDimensions\":\"6 x 1.3 x 9 inches\",\"weight\":\"1.3 pounds\"}",

In the fall of 2015, they were hired to look into the finances of Donald Trump.\\n\\nWhat began as a march through a mind-boggling trove of lawsuits, bankruptcies, and sketchy overseas projects soon took a darker turn: The deeper Fusion dug, the more it began to notice names that Simpson and Fritsch had come across during their days covering Russian corruption—and the clearer it became that the focus of Fusion’s research going forward would be Trump’s entanglements with Russia.\\n\\nTo help them make sense of what they were seeing, Simpson and Fritsch engaged the services of a former British intelligence agent and Russia expert named Christopher Steele. He would produce a series of memos—which collectively became known as the Steele dossier—that raised deeply alarming questions about the nature of Trump’s ties to a hostile foreign power. Those memos made their way to U.S. intelligence agencies, and then to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump. On January 10, 2017, the Steele dossier broke into public view, and the Trump-Russia story reached escape velocity. At the time, Fusion GPS was just a ten-person consulting firm tucked away above a Starbucks near Dupont Circle, but it would soon be thrust into the center of the biggest news story on the planet—a story that would lead to accusations of witch hunts, a relentless campaign of persecution by congressional Republicans, bizarre conspiracy theories, lawsuits by Russian oligarchs, and the Mueller report.\\n\\nIn Crime in Progress, Simpson and Fritsch tell their story for the first time—a tale of the high-stakes pursuit of one of the biggest, most important stories of our time—no matter the costs.\",\"imgURLs\":[\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515tSWM6tpL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\"],\"productDimensions\":\"6.4 x 1.2 x 9.5 inches\",\"weight\":\"1.3 pounds\"}",

Trump. The real estate developer from Queens promised to bring his brash, zero-sum swagger to bear to cut through America's most complex national security issues, and he did. If the cost of his \\\"America First\\\" agenda was bulldozing the edifice of foreign alliances that had been carefully tended by every president from Truman to Obama, then so be it.\\n\\nIt was clear from the first that Trump's inclinations were radically more blunt force than his predecessors'. When briefed by the Pentagon on Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, he exclaimed, \\\"The next time Iran sends its boats into the Strait: blow them out of the water! Let's get Mad Dog on this.\\\" When told that the capital of South Korea, Seoul, was so close to the North Korean border that millions of people would likely die in the first hours of any all-out war, Trump had a bold response, \\\"They have to move.\\\" The officials in the Oval Office weren't sure if he was joking. He raised his voice. \\\"They have to move!\\\"\\n\\nVery quickly, it became clear to a number of people at the highest levels of government that their gravest mission was to protect America from Donald Trump. Trump and His Generals is Peter Bergen's riveting account of what happened when the unstoppable force of President Trump met the immovable object of America's national security establishment--the CIA, the State Department, and, above all, the Pentagon. If there is a real \\\"deep state\\\" in DC, it is not the FBI so much as the national security community, with its deep-rooted culture and hierarchy. The men Trump selected for his key national security positions, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, and H. R. McMaster, were products of that culture: Trump wanted generals, and he got them. Three years later, they would be gone, and the guardrails were off.\\n\\nFrom Iraq and Afghanistan to Syria and Iran, from Russia and China to North Korea and Islamist terrorism, Trump and His Generals is a brilliant reckoning with an American ship of state navigating a roiling sea of threats without a well-functioning rudder. Lucid and gripping, it brings urgently needed clarity to issues that affect the fate of us all. But clarity, unfortunately, is not the same thing as reassurance.\",\"imgURLs\":[\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KEW2BJ6WL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg\"],\"productDimensions\":\"6.4 x 1.3 x 9.5 inches\",\"weight\":\"1.4 pounds\"}"
